It uses Hungarian notation with the str prefix for string fields and contains both legacy fields (strCustID, strFullName) and new migration compatibility fields (cust_id, custo…

**System answer:**
> The `tblCustomer` table stores customer master data from the legacy CRM system. In the business glossary, the `Customer` entity is defined as an individual or organization that has purchased products or services from the company, and customers are stored in `tblCustomer` with legacy identifiers inherited from the AS/400 system. It is the physical implementation of the CustomerMaster customer conce…

### ✅ 2 — How are customers identified in the legacy system?

**Status:** GROUNDED  
**GT Coverage:** 100% | **Top Score:** 0.8295 | **Gate:** `proceed`

**Expected answer:**
> Customers are identified by strCustID, which is a VARCHAR(50) field containing alphanumeric customer codes inherited from an AS/400 system. These codes follow formats like C-XXXXX or REG-XXXX and can contain letters, numbers, and hyphens.

**System answer:**
> In the legacy CustomerMaster system, customers are identified by `tblCustomer.strCustID`. This is the primary key for `tblCustomer`, and the business glossary says it is the customer’s unique customer code and that customers use legacy identifiers inherited from the AS/400 system.

The data dictionary further defines `strCustID` as a `VARCHAR(50)` alphanumeric customer code in formats such as `C-X…

### ✅ 3 — What table stores order header information and what is its primary key?

**Status:** GROUNDED  
**GT Coverage:** 100% | **Top Score:** 0.5852 | **Gate:** `proceed`

**Expected answer:**
> Order header information is stored in the vw_SalesOrderHdr table despite the vw_ prefix suggesting it's a view. The primary key is lngOrderID, which is an INT field using the lng (long integer) Hungarian notation prefix.

**System answer:**
> Order header information is stored in VW_SALESORDERHDR, which implements the business concept “Sales order header records.”

The context does not explicitly mark a primary key, but lngOrderID is the order identifier column and is the field referenced by ORD_LINE_ITEM.ORD_ID, TBLPAYMENT.ORDERID, and TBLORDERSTATUSHISTORY.ORDERID to VW_SALESORDERHDR.LNGORDERID, so lngOrderID is the key column used f…

### ✅ 4 — Which table in the schema uses a SQL reserved word as its name?

**Status:** GROUNDED  
**GT Coverage:** 100% | **Top Score:** 0.5119 | **Gate:** `proceed`

**Expected answer:**
> The schema includes two tables that use SQL reserved words: 'Group' (for product categories) and 'User' (for system users). These require square bracket quoting [Group] and [User] in SQL queries to avoid syntax errors.

**System answer:**
> The schema uses two SQL reserved words as table names: `Group` and `User`. The context says these must be quoted as `[Group]` and `[User]`.

### ✅ 5 — What is the relationship between vw_SalesOrderHdr and tblCustomer?

**Status:** GROUNDED  
**GT Coverage:** 100% | **Top Score:** 0.9940 | **Gate:** `proceed`

**Expected answer:**
> vw_SalesOrderHdr has a foreign key relationship with tblCustomer through the intCustID field, which references strCustID. Despite the int prefix suggesting an integer, intCustID is actually a VARCHAR(50) field matching the strCustID data type.

**System answer:**
> `vw_SalesOrderHdr` references `tblCustomer` through a foreign key from `vw_SalesOrderHdr.intCustID` to `tblCustomer.strCustID`. This means each sales order header is associated with a customer record in `tblCustomer`.

From the glossary and data dictionary, `tblCustomer` stores customer master data, and migration guidance says it is required for all orders, which aligns with this relationship. The…

### ✅ 6 — What naming convention is used for the inventory transaction log table?

**Status:** GROUNDED  
**GT Coverage:** 100% | **Top Score:** 0.9306 | **Gate:** `proceed`

**Expected answer:**
> The inventory transaction log table is named 'inv_txn_log' using abbreviated naming with underscore separators. Field names within this table are also heavily abbreviated: txn_id (transaction ID), txn_dt (transaction date), txn_type (transaction type), and prod_id (product ID).

**System answer:**
> The inventory transaction log table is `inv_txn_log`, and the retrieved context states its naming convention is “heavily abbreviated.” The legacy-system naming section also shows that `inv_` is one of the table-prefix conventions used in the system.

### ✅ 7 — What data quality issue exists in the tblProduct unit_cost field?

**Status:** GROUNDED  
**GT Coverage:** 100% | **Top Score:** 0.8594 | **Gate:** `proceed`

**Expected answer:**
> The tblProduct.unit_cost field has an inappropriate data type - it's defined as VARCHAR(20) instead of DECIMAL. This field contains currency symbols like '$19.99' which require parsing before calculations can be performed, making it unusable for mathematical operations without transformation.

**System answer:**
> The `tblProduct.unit_cost` field has a data quality issue because it is defined as `VARCHAR 20` even though it stores cost values. The context explicitly marks this as a bug: it should be `DECIMAL`, and it contains currency symbols such as `"$19.99"`, so the values must be parsed before calculations. This is also identified more generally as an inappropriate data type in the migration notes.

### ✅ 8 — How does the ord_line_item table handle product data redundancy?

**Status:** GROUNDED  
**GT Coverage:** 100% | **Top Score:** 0.6603 | **Gate:** `proceed`

**Expected answer:**
> The ord_line_item table contains redundant copies of product data (product_code and item_name) that are denormalized for reporting performance and to snapshot product information at the time of order. These fields may become out of sync with the tblProduct master and should not be updated from produ…

**System answer:**
> `ord_line_item` stores the product in two ways: normalized and redundant.

The normalized link is `prod_id`, which is a foreign key to `TBLPRODUCT.INTPRODID`. But the table also keeps denormalized product attributes:

`product_code` is a redundant copy of `tblProduct.strSKU`. It exists for reporting performance, but it may become out of sync with the master product record.

`item_name` is a redund…

### ✅ 9 — What are the valid values for the strOrderStatus field in vw_SalesOrderHdr?

**Status:** GROUNDED  
**GT Coverage:** 100% | **Top Score:** 0.9131 | **Gate:** `proceed`

**Expected answer:**
> The strOrderStatus field accepts three values enforced by a CHECK constraint: 'PENDING' (order received but not shipped), 'SHIPPED' (order has been shipped to customer), and 'CANCELLED' (order cancelled before shipping).

**System answer:**
> The retrieved context does not provide an enumerated list of valid values for `vw_SalesOrderHdr.strOrderStatus`.

What the context does confirm is:
`strOrderStatus` is a column on `VW_SALESORDERHDR` alongside `lngOrderID`, `intCustID`, `dtmOrderDate`, `dtmShipDate`, `dtmRequiredDate`, `fltSubTotal`, `fltTaxAmount`, `fltTotalAmount`, `strShippingMethod`, and `strTrackingNumber`.

### ✅ 10 — Which table stores payment information and what security issue does it have?

**Status:** GROUNDED  
**GT Coverage:** 100% | **Top Score:** 0.3347 | **Gate:** `proceed`

**Expected answer:**
> Payment information is stored in the tblPayment table. The table has a critical security issue: the CardNumberText field stores full unencrypted credit card numbers as VARCHAR(100), which is a PCI compliance violation. The system also lacks proper tokenization and encryption at rest.

**System answer:**
> Payment information is stored in TBLPAYMENT (also referred to as tblPayment), which implements the business concept “payment records.” It contains fields such as PaymentID, OrderID, PaymentMethod, PaymentDate, Amount, PaymentStatus, CardNumberText, CardHolderName, and AuthorizationCode.

The security issue is that tblPayment.CardNumberText stores unencrypted card numbers in plaintext. The context …

### ✅ 11 — What is the purpose of the bolActive field in tblCustomer and tblProduct?

**Status:** GROUNDED  
**GT Coverage:** 100% | **Top Score:** 0.9646 | **Gate:** `proceed`

**Expected answer:**
> The bolActive field (using Hungarian notation 'bol' for boolean/bit) is a flag indicating whether a record is active. In tblCustomer, it marks whether customers are included in marketing (1=active, 0=inactive). In tblProduct, it indicates product availability (1=available for sale, 0=discontinued).

**System answer:**
> In `tblCustomer`, `bolActive` is used to mark whether a customer is active or inactive. The business glossary states that customers can be marked as inactive with `bolActive = 0`, but they are never deleted.

In `tblProduct`, `bolActive` is used to indicate whether a product is active versus discontinued/inactive. This is supported by the context noting that `tblProduct` contains both active and d…

### ✅ 12 — How are inventory transactions tracked in the system?

**Status:** GROUNDED  
**GT Coverage:** 100% | **Top Score:** 0.1660 | **Gate:** `proceed_with_warning`

**Expected answer:**
> Inventory transactions are tracked in the inv_txn_log table, which records all stock movements. Each transaction has a type (txn_type): 'IN' for receipts, 'OUT' for shipments, and 'ADJ' for corrections. The table uses heavily abbreviated field names and references products via prod_id.

**System answer:**
> Inventory transactions are tracked through the `INV_TXN_LOG` physical table, whose business concept is the `inventory audit trail`.

This table’s purpose is explicitly “Inventory transaction log,” and it records each inventory adjustment as a separate transaction with these fields: `txn_id`, `prod_id`, `txn_type`, `qty`, `txn_dt`, `ref_num`, `user_id`, and `notes`.

### ✅ 13 — What is the self-referencing relationship in the Group table?

**Status:** GROUNDED  
**GT Coverage:** 100% | **Top Score:** 0.8372 | **Gate:** `proceed`

**Expected answer:**
> The Group table has a self-referencing foreign key where ParentGroupID references GroupID, creating a hierarchical structure for product categories. A NULL ParentGroupID indicates a top-level group, while non-NULL values create nested category levels.

**System answer:**
> The `GROUP` table is self-referencing through `ParentGroupID`, which is a foreign key to `GROUP.GroupID`. This implements a one-to-many Group → Group hierarchy, where each group can have a parent group and can also have multiple child groups.

### ✅ 14 — What migration compatibility columns exist in tblCustomer?

**Status:** GROUNDED

### ✅ 16 — What is the inconsistent naming pattern between order tables?

**Status:** GROUNDED  
**GT Coverage:** 100% | **Top Score:** 0.2869 | **Gate:** `proceed`

**Expected answer:**
> The schema shows inconsistent naming: order headers use 'vw_SalesOrderHdr' with Hungarian notation, while line items use 'ord_line_item' with abbreviated underscore notation. Additionally, the line item table references lngOrderID but names its foreign key 'ord_id' instead of 'order_id' or 'lngOrder…

**System answer:**
> The order-related tables use inconsistent naming conventions: the order header is named `vw_SalesOrderHdr`, which uses a `vw_` prefix even though it is actually a table, while the order detail table is named `ord_line_item`, which uses an `ord_` prefix with lowercase underscore-separated naming. This shows mixed conventions for order tables instead of a single standard.

### ✅ 17 — What deprecated fields exist in tblProduct and why should they be avoided?

**Status:** GROUNDED  
**GT Coverage:** 100% | **Top Score:** 0.6637 | **Gate:** `proceed`

**Expected answer:**
> The tblProduct table contains three deprecated fields: prod_num (superseded by strSKU), item_desc (superseded by strDescription), and unit_cost (wrong data type with VARCHAR instead of DECIMAL). These fields should not be used in new code as they represent outdated design decisions.

**System answer:**
> In `tblProduct`, the deprecated fields are `prod_num`, `item_desc`, and `unit_cost`.

`prod_num` (`VARCHAR 20`) is the old legacy product number. It has been superseded by `strSKU` and is retained only for historical reporting, so it should be avoided for new code.

`item_desc` (`VARCHAR 500`) is the old truncated description. It has been superseded by `strDescription`, and the context explicitly …

### ✅ 18 — How are shipping carriers configured in the system?

**Status:** GROUNDED  
**GT Coverage:** 100% | **Top Score:** 0.2613 | **Gate:** `proceed`

### ✅ 20 — What fields in vw_SalesOrderHdr use the 'flt' Hungarian notation prefix and what do they store?

**Status:** GROUNDED  
**GT Coverage:** 100% | **Top Score:** 0.9078 | **Gate:** `proceed`

**Expected answer:**
> The vw_SalesOrderHdr table uses the 'flt' (float) prefix for three monetary fields: fltSubTotal (line item subtotal before tax), fltTaxAmount (calculated tax), and fltTotalAmount (final total including tax and shipping). Despite the 'flt' prefix suggesting floating-point, these are defined as DECIMA…

**System answer:**
> In `VW_SALESORDERHDR`, the fields with the `flt` Hungarian notation prefix are `fltSubTotal`, `fltTaxAmount`, and `fltTotalAmount`.

From the legacy notation guidelines, `flt` indicates a float/money-style field, i.e. a `DECIMAL` amount. Based on the field names, they store the order subtotal, the tax amount, and the total order amount respectively.

### ✅ 21 — How does the schema handle the different date/time field naming conventions?

**Status:** GROUNDED  
**GT Coverage:** 100% | **Top Score:** 0.1757 | **Gate:** `proceed_with_warning`

**Expected answer:**

The User table breaks …

**System answer:**
> The schema does not use a single consistent date/time naming convention.

In the legacy/Hungarian notation pattern, `dtm` indicates a `DATETIME` field.

### ✅ 23 — What foreign key relationships exist for the vw_SalesOrderHdr table?

**Status:** GROUNDED  
**GT Coverage:** 100% | **Top Score:** 0.9902 | **Gate:** `proceed`

**Expected answer:**
> The vw_SalesOrderHdr table has one explicit foreign key constraint: intCustID references tblCustomer.strCustID. Implicit relationships (not enforced by FK constraints) include tblPayment.OrderID, tblOrderStatusHistory.OrderID, and ord_line_item.ord_id all referencing vw_SalesOrderHdr.lngOrderID.

**System answer:**
> For `VW_SALESORDERHDR`, the retrieved context shows both one outbound foreign key relationship and several inbound ones.

`VW_SALESORDERHDR` references `TBLCUSTOMER` through `INTCUSTID -> TBLCUSTOMER.STRCUSTID`. The table metadata also confirms `VW_SALESORDERHDR` contains the columns `lngOrderID` and `intCustID`.
