**Status:** GROUNDED  
**GT Coverage:** 100% | **Top Score:** 0.9921 | **Gate:** `proceed`

**Expected answer:**
> The tblCustomer table stores customer master data including customer codes, names, email addresses, and region information. It uses Hungarian notation with the str prefix for string fields and contains both legacy fields (strCustID, strFullName) and new migration compatibility fields (cust_id, custo…

**System answer:**
> The `tblCustomer` table’s purpose is to store customer master data from the legacy CRM system (CustomerMaster v3.2.1). It holds customer identifiers inherited from the AS/400 system, along with customer master attributes.

### ✅ 2 — How are customers identified in the legacy system?

**Status:** GROUNDED  
**GT Coverage:** 100% | **Top Score:** 0.8295 | **Gate:** `proceed`

**Expected answer:**
> Customers are identified by strCustID, which is a VARCHAR(50) field containing alphanumeric customer codes inherited from an AS/400 system. These codes follow formats like C-XXXXX or REG-XXXX and can contain letters, numbers, and hyphens.

**System answer:**
> In the legacy CustomerMaster v3.2.1 system, customers are identified by the primary key `tblCustomer.strCustID`, described as a unique alphanumeric customer code inherited from the AS/400 system (format examples: `C-XXXXX` or `REG-XXXX`). This `strCustID` is `NOT NULL` and `UNIQUE` in `tblCustomer`.

### ✅ 3 — What table stores order header information and what is its primary key?

**Status:** GROUNDED  
**GT Coverage:** 100% | **Top Score:** 0.5852 | **Gate:** `proceed`

**Expected answer:**
> Order header information is stored in the vw_SalesOrderHdr table despite the vw_ prefix suggesting it's a view. The primary key is lngOrderID, which is an INT field using the lng (long integer) Hungarian notation prefix.

**System answer:**
> Order header information is stored by the physical table `VW_SALESORDERHDR` (business concept “Sales order header records”), which includes columns such as `lngOrderID`, `intCustID`, order and ship dates, order status, and monetary/shipping fields. The retrieved context does not specify a primary key for `VW_SALESORDERHDR`, so the primary key is not stated in the knowledge graph.

**Sources retrieved (12):** `Sales order header records→VW_SALESORDERHDR`, `parent_chunk_data_dictionary.txt_5`, `Order Status History→TBLORDERSTATUSHISTORY`, `parent_chunk_data_dictionary.txt_7`, `parent_chunk_data_dictionary.txt_4`, `parent_chunk_business_glossary.md_3`, `Order line item→ORD_LINE_ITEM`, `parent_chunk_business_glossary.md_0`

### ✅ 4 — Which table in the schema uses a SQL reserved word as its name?

**Status:** GROUNDED  
**GT Coverage:** 100% | **Top Score:** 0.5119 | **Gate:** `proceed`

**Expected answer:**
> The schema includes two tables that use SQL reserved words: 'Group' (for product categories) and 'User' (for system users). These require square bracket quoting [Group] and [User] in SQL queries to avoid syntax errors.

**System answer:**
> The context says the tables named `Group` (product categories) and `User` (system users) use SQL reserved words as their names, and they “must be quoted” as `[Group]` and `[User]` (Legacy System Quirks).

**Sources retrieved (12):** `parent_chunk_business_glossary.md_2`, `parent_chunk_data_dictionary.txt_6`, `parent_chunk_data_dictionary.txt_8`, `parent_chunk_data_dictionary.txt_5`, `parent_chunk_data_dictionary.txt_7`, `parent_chunk_data_dictionary.txt_4`, `parent_chunk_business_glossary.md_0`, `parent_chunk_business_glossary.md_3`

### ✅ 5 — What is the relationship between vw_SalesOrderHdr and tblCustomer?

**Status:** GROUNDED  
**GT Coverage:** 100% | **Top Score:** 0.9940 | **Gate:** `proceed`

**Expected answer:**
> vw_SalesOrderHdr has a foreign key relationship with tblCustomer through the intCustID field, which references strCustID. Despite the int prefix suggesting an integer, intCustID is actually a VARCHAR(50) field matching the strCustID data type.

**System answer:**
> `vw_SALESORDERHDR` references `tblCustomer` through a foreign key relationship: `vw_SALESORDERHDR.INTCUSTID` → `tblCustomer.STRCUSTID` (see the FKRelationship described as “VW_SALESORDERHDR references TBLCUSTOMER via foreign key INTCUSTID -> TBLCUSTOMER.STRCUSTID”).

### ✅ 6 — What naming convention is used for the inventory transaction log table?

**Status:** GROUNDED  
**GT Coverage:** 100% | **Top Score:** 0.9306 | **Gate:** `proceed`

**Expected answer:**
> The inventory transaction log table is named 'inv_txn_log' using abbreviated naming with underscore separators. Field names within this table are also heavily abbreviated: txn_id (transaction ID), txn_dt (transaction date), txn_type (transaction type), and prod_id (product ID).

**System answer:**
> The inventory transaction log table is named `inv_txn_log`, and its naming convention is described as “Heavily abbreviated.”

### ✅ 7 — What data quality issue exists in the tblProduct unit_cost field?

**Status:** GROUNDED  
**GT Coverage:** 100% | **Top Score:** 0.8594 | **Gate:** `proceed`

**Expected answer:**
> The tblProduct.unit_cost field has an inappropriate data type - it's defined as VARCHAR(20) instead of DECIMAL. This field contains currency symbols like '$19.99' which require parsing before calculations can be performed, making it unusable for mathematical operations without transformation.

**System answer:**
> The data quality issue is that `tblProduct.unit_cost` is stored as a string (VARCHAR) but it “should be DECIMAL”; additionally, it “contains currency symbols (e.g., `$19.99`)” and “requires parsing before calculations.”

**Sources retrieved (12):** `parent_chunk_business_glossary.md_3`, `parent_chunk_business_glossary.md_2`, `parent_chunk_data_dictionary.txt_8`, `Product Catalogue→TBLPRODUCT`, `parent_chunk_data_dictionary.txt_6`, `parent_chunk_data_dictionary.txt_5`, `parent_chunk_data_dictionary.txt_7`, `ORD_LINE_ITEM→TBLPRODUCT`

### ✅ 8 — How does the ord_line_item table handle product data redundancy?

**Status:** GROUNDED  
**GT Coverage:** 100% | **Top Score:** 0.7155 | **Gate:** `proceed`

**Expected answer:**
> The ord_line_item table contains redundant copies of product data (product_code and item_name) that are denormalized for reporting performance and to snapshot product information at the time of order. These fields may become out of sync with the tblProduct master and should not be updated from produ…

**System answer:**
> The `ord_line_item` table handles product data redundancy by denormalizing key product attributes into each order line item. Specifically, it includes `product_code` (a redundant copy of the product’s SKU from `tblProduct`) and `item_name` (a redundant, snapshotted copy of the product name captured at order time). These denormalized fields are used for reporting performance, and `item_name` does n…

**Status:** GROUNDED  
**GT Coverage:** 100% | **Top Score:** 0.9131 | **Gate:** `proceed`

**Expected answer:**
> The strOrderStatus field accepts three values enforced by a CHECK constraint: 'PENDING' (order received but not shipped), 'SHIPPED' (order has been shipped to customer), and 'CANCELLED' (order cancelled before shipping).

**System answer:**
> I cannot find this information in the knowledge graph.

**Sources retrieved (12):** `parent_chunk_data_dictionary.txt_5`, `Sales order header records→VW_SALESORDERHDR`, `parent_chunk_data_dictionary.txt_7`, `parent_chunk_business_glossary.md_0`, `parent_chunk_business_glossary.md_3`, `parent_chunk_business_glossary.md_2`, `TBLORDERSTATUSHISTORY→VW_SALESORDERHDR`, `VW_SALESORDERHDR→TBLCUSTOMER`

### ✅ 10 — Which table stores payment information and what security issue does it have?

**Status:** GROUNDED  
**GT Coverage:** 100% | **Top Score:** 0.7727 | **Gate:** `proceed`

**Expected answer:**
> Payment information is stored in the tblPayment table. The table has a critical security issue: the CardNumberText field stores full unencrypted credit card numbers as VARCHAR(100), which is a PCI compliance violation. The system also lacks proper tokenization and encryption at rest.

**System answer:**
> Payment information is stored in the table `tblPayment` (it includes the column `CardNumberText`). The security issue is that `tblPayment.CardNumberText` stores unencrypted card numbers as plaintext (a DDL comment explicitly flags “Full card number stored as text! - Should be tokenized - Contains unencrypted PAN (Primary Account Number)”).

**Sources retrieved (12):** `Plaintext card numbers→TBLPAYMENT`, `parent_chunk_business_glossary.md_3`, `parent_chunk_data_dictionary.txt_7`, `parent_chunk_data_dictionary.txt_8`, `parent_chunk_data_dictionary.txt_4`, `parent_chunk_business_glossary.md_0`, `TBLPAYMENT→VW_SALESORDERHDR`, `parent_chunk_business_glossary.md_2`

### ✅ 11 — What is the purpose of the bolActive field in tblCustomer and tblProduct?

**Status:** GROUNDED  
**GT Coverage:** 100% | **Top Score:** 0.9646 | **Gate:** `proceed`

**Expected answer:**
> The bolActive field (using Hungarian notation 'bol' for boolean/bit) is a flag indicating whether a record is active. In tblCustomer, it marks whether customers are included in marketing (1=active, 0=inactive). In tblProduct, it indicates product availability (1=available for sale, 0=discontinued).

**System answer:**
> In `tblCustomer`, `bolActive` is used to mark whether a customer is active or inactive; customers can be marked as inactive (`bolActive = 0`) but are never deleted.

In `TBLPRODUCT`, `bolActive` is the “active flag” that indicates whether the product entry is currently active (i.e., whether it is a sellable/available product in the catalog context).

### ✅ 12 — How are inventory transactions tracked in the system?

**Status:** GROUNDED  
**GT Coverage:** 100% | **Top Score:** 0.2666 | **Gate:** `proceed`

**Expected answer:**
> Inventory transactions are tracked in the inv_txn_log table, which records all stock movements. Each transaction has a type (txn_type): 'IN' for receipts, 'OUT' for shipments, and 'ADJ' for corrections. The table uses heavily abbreviated field names and references products via prod_id.

**System answer:**
> Inventory transactions are tracked in the physical table `inv_txn_log` (referenced in the business concept “Product inventory movement”). Each record logs a product quantity change over time with `txn_dt`, identifies the product via `prod_id`, and records the transaction direction/type via `txn_type` (which includes receipts `IN`, shipments/other outflows `OUT`, and corrections `ADJ`).

### ✅ 13 — What is the self-referencing relationship in the Group table?

**Status:** GROUNDED  
**GT Coverage:** 100% | **Top Score:** 0.5608 | **Gate:** `proceed`

**Expected answer:**
> The Group table has a self-referencing foreign key where ParentGroupID references GroupID, creating a hierarchical structure for product categories. A NULL ParentGroupID indicates a top-level group, while non-NULL values create nested category levels.

**System answer:**
> In the `GROUP` table (the “Category Group” concept), the self-referencing relationship is implemented via `ParentGroupID`, which is a foreign key that references `GROUP.GROUPID` (i.e., `PARENTGROUPID -> GROUP.GROUPID`). This allows groups to be arranged hierarchically (a group can have a parent group).

> The tblCustomer table includes cust_id (INT) and customer_name (VARCHAR 255) as migration compatibility columns alongside the legacy strCustID and strFullName fields. These are intended for the new ERP system that will use integer IDs and standardized naming conventions.

**System answer:**
> In the retrieved context, the business concept “CustomerMaster v3.2.1 (Legacy)” is implemented by physical table `TBLCUSTOMER` (migration-related column mapping). The columns listed for `TBLCUSTOMER` are: `strCustID`, `strFullName`, `strEmail`, `strRegion`, `strCountry`, `dtmCreated`, `dtmLastModified`, `bolActive`, `cust_id`, `customer_name`, and `txtNotes`.

### ✅ 16 — What is the inconsistent naming pattern between order tables?

**Status:** GROUNDED

**Expected answer:**
> The schema shows inconsistent naming: order headers use 'vw_SalesOrderHdr' with Hungarian notation, while line items use 'ord_line_item' with abbreviated underscore notation. Additionally, the line item table references lngOrderID but names its foreign key 'ord_id' instead of 'order_id' or 'lngOrder…

**System answer:**
> The retrieved context says the system uses inconsistent table naming conventions across the order-related tables:

`vw_` is used in `vw_SalesOrderHdr` (but it is “actually tables”), while order line items use the `ord_` naming pattern in `ord_line_item`, and order status audit uses the verbose `tbl` prefix in `tblOrderStatusHistory`.

### ✅ 17 — What deprecated fields exist in tblProduct and why should they be avoided?

**Status:** GROUNDED  
**GT Coverage:** 100% | **Top Score:** 0.6844 | **Gate:** `proceed`

**Expected answer:**
> The tblProduct table contains three deprecated fields: prod_num (superseded by strSKU), item_desc (superseded by strDescription), and unit_cost (wrong data type with VARCHAR instead of DECIMAL). These fields should not be used in new code as they represent outdated design decisions.

**System answer:**
> In the context for the Product Catalogue implemented by `TBLPRODUCT`, the deprecated legacy fields are `prod_num` and `item_desc`, and `unit_cost`.

`prod_num` is described as an “OLD: Legacy product number” that has been superseded by `strSKU`, but it is retained for historical reporting, so it should not be used for new code.

`item_desc` is described as an “OLD: Truncated description” supersede…

### ✅ 19 — What is the relationship between User table passwords and security?

**Status:** GROUNDED  
**GT Coverage:** 100% | **Top Score:** 0.0401 | **Gate:** `proceed_with_warning`

**Expected answer:**
> The User table stores password hashes in the PasswordHash field, but uses SHA-256 without salt, making it vulnerable to rainbow table attacks. This is identified as a security issue in the data dictionary. Additionally, the table name 'User' is a SQL reserved word requiring square bracket quoting.

**System answer:**
> In the context, system users are stored in the physical table `User` (also described as `USER`), which includes the column `PasswordHash`.

### ✅ 20 — What fields in vw_SalesOrderHdr use the 'flt' Hungarian notation prefix and what do they store?

**Status:** GROUNDED  
**GT Coverage:** 100% | **Top Score:** 0.9078 | **Gate:** `proceed`

**Expected answer:**
> The vw_SalesOrderHdr table uses the 'flt' (float) prefix for three monetary fields: fltSubTotal (line item subtotal before tax), fltTaxAmount (calculated tax), and fltTotalAmount (final total including tax and shipping). Despite the 'flt' prefix suggesting floating-point, these are defined as DECIMA…

**System answer:**
> In the `vw_SalesOrderHdr` / physical table `VW_SALESORDERHDR`, the fields that use the Hungarian notation prefix `flt` are `fltSubTotal`, `fltTaxAmount`, and `fltTotalAmount` (listed as columns in `VW_SALESORDERHDR`).

### ✅ 21 — How does the schema handle the different date/time field naming conventions?

**Status:** GROUNDED  
**GT Coverage:** 100% | **Top Score:** 0.1757 | **Gate:** `proceed_with_warning`

**Expected answer:**
> The schema uses 'dtm' (datetime) Hungarian notation prefix consistently: dtmCreated and dtmLastModified in tblCustomer, dtmOrderDate/dtmShipDate/dtmRequiredDate in vw_SalesOrderHdr, dtmIntroduced/dtmDiscontinued in tblProduct, and txn_dt in inv_txn_log (abbreviated exception). The User table breaks …

**System answer:**
> The schema contains multiple date/time naming conventions, not a single consistent standard.

In the product-related portion, the legacy schema uses Hungarian notation for datetime fields: `dtmIntroduced` (DATETIME) and `dtmDiscontinued` (DATETIME) in the product catalogue concept. In the general “Hungarian Notation” guidance, `dtm` is explicitly defined as the prefix meaning datetime (DATETIME).

### ✅ 23 — What foreign key relationships exist for the vw_SalesOrderHdr table?

**Status:** GROUNDED

### ✅ 24 — How does the legacy system handle product SKU format and uniqueness?

**Status:** GROUNDED  
**GT Coverage:** 100% | **Top Score:** 0.3256 | **Gate:** `proceed`

**Expected answer:**
> Product SKUs are stored in the strSKU field with a UNIQUE constraint. The format follows Category-Color-Size pattern (e.g., 'SHIRT-BLU-L'). The deprecated prod_num field also exists but should not be used. SKUs are used in foreign key references from ord_line_item through the denormalized product_co…

**System answer:**
> The retrieved context states that the legacy system’s product catalog uses `TBLPRODUCT` to store SKU values in the `strSKU` column, and that the older `prod_num` field is deprecated and “superseded by `strSKU`” (see the `tblProduct`/legacy deprecated fields notes in the context).
