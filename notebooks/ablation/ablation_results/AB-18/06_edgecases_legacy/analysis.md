### ✅ 1 — What is the purpose of the tblCustomer table?

**Status:** GROUNDED  
**GT Coverage:** 100% | **Top Score:** 0.9921 | **Gate:** `proceed`

**Expected answer:**
> The tblCustomer table stores customer master data including customer codes, names, email addresses, and region information. It uses Hungarian notation with the str prefix for string fields and contains both legacy fields (strCustID, strFullName) and new migration compatibility fields (cust_id, custo…

**System answer:**
> The `tblCustomer` table stores customer master data from the legacy CRM system. In business terms, it represents customers—individuals or organizations that have purchased products or services from the company—and stores them using legacy identifiers inherited from the AS/400 system.

**GT Coverage:** 100% | **Top Score:** 0.8295 | **Gate:** `proceed`

**Expected answer:**
> Customers are identified by strCustID, which is a VARCHAR(50) field containing alphanumeric customer codes inherited from an AS/400 system. These codes follow formats like C-XXXXX or REG-XXXX and can contain letters, numbers, and hyphens.

**System answer:**
> Customers in the legacy system are identified in `tblCustomer` by `strCustID`, which is the primary key and the required unique customer code. It is an alphanumeric identifier inherited from the AS/400 system, stored as `VARCHAR(50)`, not null, and unique. The documented format is `C-XXXXX` or `REG-XXXX`, and it can contain letters, numbers, and hyphens.

### ✅ 3 — What table stores order header information and what is its primary key?

**Status:** GROUNDED  
**GT Coverage:** 100% | **Top Score:** 0.7567 | **Gate:** `proceed`

**Expected answer:**
> Order header information is stored in the vw_SalesOrderHdr table despite the vw_ prefix suggesting it's a view. The primary key is lngOrderID, which is an INT field using the lng (long integer) Hungarian notation prefix.

**System answer:**
> Order header information is stored in the `VW_SALESORDERHDR` table, which implements the business concept “Sales order header records.”

The identifier used for that table is `lngOrderID`. The context shows other tables reference `VW_SALESORDERHDR.LNGORDERID` via foreign keys (`ORD_LINE_ITEM.ord_id` and `TBLPAYMENT.OrderID`), but it does not explicitly state that `lngOrderID` is the primary key.

**Sources retrieved (12):** `Order Line Item`, `Sales order header records→VW_SALESORDERHDR`, `Order Line Item→ORD_LINE_ITEM`, `parent_chunk_data_dictionary.txt_5`, `parent_chunk_data_dictionary.txt_7`, `parent_chunk_data_dictionary.txt_4`, `parent_chunk_business_glossary.md_3`, `parent_chunk_business_glossary.md_0`

### ✅ 4 — Which table in the schema uses a SQL reserved word as its name?

**Status:** GROUNDED  
**GT Coverage:** 100% | **Top Score:** 0.5119 | **Gate:** `proceed`

**Expected answer:**
> The schema includes two tables that use SQL reserved words: 'Group' (for product categories) and 'User' (for system users). These require square bracket quoting [Group] and [User] in SQL queries to avoid syntax errors.

**System answer:**
> The schema uses two SQL reserved words as table names: `Group` and `User`. The context says both are reserved words and must be quoted as `[Group]` and `[User]`.

### ✅ 5 — What is the relationship between vw_SalesOrderHdr and tblCustomer?

**Status:** GROUNDED  
**GT Coverage:** 100% | **Top Score:** 0.9940 | **Gate:** `proceed`

**Expected answer:**
> vw_SalesOrderHdr has a foreign key relationship with tblCustomer through the intCustID field, which references strCustID. Despite the int prefix suggesting an integer, intCustID is actually a VARCHAR(50) field matching the strCustID data type.

**System answer:**
> `vw_SalesOrderHdr` references `tblCustomer` through the foreign key `intCustID -> tblCustomer.strCustID`.

This means each sales order header record in `VW_SALESORDERHDR` is linked to a customer master record in `tblCustomer` using the customer code. The order-side column is `intCustID`, and the customer primary key is `strCustID`. The context also notes a legacy naming quirk: although the column …

### ✅ 6 — What naming convention is used for the inventory transaction log table?

**Status:** GROUNDED  
**GT Coverage:** 100% | **Top Score:** 0.9785 | **Gate:** `proceed`

**Expected answer:**
> The inventory transaction log table is named 'inv_txn_log' using abbreviated naming with underscore separators. Field names within this table are also heavily abbreviated: txn_id (transaction ID), txn_dt (transaction date), txn_type (transaction type), and prod_id (product ID).

**System answer:**
> The inventory transaction log table, `inv_txn_log` / `INV_TXN_LOG`, uses a heavily abbreviated naming convention. In the legacy system’s table naming patterns, it also follows the `inv_` prefix convention.

**Sources retrieved (12):** `Inventory Transaction Log`, `parent_chunk_data_dictionary.txt_6`, `Inventory Transaction Log→INV_TXN_LOG`, `parent_chunk_business_glossary.md_2`, `parent_chunk_data_dictionary.txt_7`, `parent_chunk_business_glossary.md_3`, `parent_chunk_data_dictionary.txt_4`, `INV_TXN_LOG→TBLPRODUCT`

### ✅ 7 — What data quality issue exists in the tblProduct unit_cost field?

**Status:** GROUNDED  
**GT Coverage:** 100% | **Top Score:** 0.8594 | **Gate:** `proceed`

**Expected answer:**
> The tblProduct.unit_cost field has an inappropriate data type - it's defined as VARCHAR(20) instead of DECIMAL. This field contains currency symbols like '$19.99' which require parsing before calculations can be performed, making it unusable for mathematical operations without transformation.

**System answer:**
> The `tblProduct.unit_cost` field has a data quality issue because it is defined as `VARCHAR 20` instead of a numeric type. The context labels this as a bug: cost is stored as a string, should be `DECIMAL`, and it contains currency symbols such as `"$19.99"`, so it must be parsed before calculations.

### ✅ 8 — How does the ord_line_item table handle product data redundancy?

**Status:** GROUNDED  
**GT Coverage:** 100% | **Top Score:** 0.6675 | **Gate:** `proceed`

**Expected answer:**
> The ord_line_item table contains redundant copies of product data (product_code and item_name) that are denormalized for reporting performance and to snapshot product information at the time of order. These fields may become out of sync with the tblProduct master and should not be updated from produ…

**System answer:**
> `ord_line_item` handles product data redundancy by storing both a normalized product reference and denormalized product attributes.

The table links to the master product record through `prod_id`, which is a foreign key to `TBLPRODUCT.INTPRODID`. In addition, it stores two redundant product fields:

`product_code`: a redundant copy of `tblProduct.strSKU`. It is denormalized for reporting performan…

### ✅ 9 — What are the valid values for the strOrderStatus field in vw_SalesOrderHdr?

**Status:** GROUNDED  
**GT Coverage:** 100% | **Top Score:** 0.9131 | **Gate:** `proceed`

**Expected answer:**
> The strOrderStatus field accepts three values enforced by a CHECK constraint: 'PENDING' (order received but not shipped), 'SHIPPED' (order has been shipped to customer), and 'CANCELLED' (order cancelled before shipping).

**System answer:**
> The retrieved context does not provide an explicit allowed-value list for `vw_SalesOrderHdr.strOrderStatus`.

What the context does confirm is that `strOrderStatus` is a column on `VW_SALESORDERHDR`, and that status changes are audited in `tblOrderStatusHistory` through `OldStatus` and `NewStatus`, both `VARCHAR 20`. In that audit table, `OldStatus` is NULL for the initial status, `NewStatus` is t…

### ✅ 10 — Which table stores payment information and what security issue does it have?

**Status:** GROUNDED  
**GT Coverage:** 100% | **Top Score:** 0.8606 | **Gate:** `proceed`

**Expected answer:**
> Payment information is stored in the tblPayment table. The table has a critical security issue: the CardNumberText field stores full unencrypted credit card numbers as VARCHAR(100), which is a PCI compliance violation. The system also lacks proper tokenization and encryption at rest.

**System answer:**
> The table is TBLPAYMENT (also referred to as tblPayment). It stores payment information including PaymentID, OrderID, PaymentMethod, PaymentDate, Amount, PaymentStatus, CardNumberText, CardHolderName, and AuthorizationCode.

The security issue is that CardNumberText stores full card numbers as unencrypted plaintext. The context explicitly says it contains unencrypted PAN data, should be tokenized,…

### ✅ 11 — What is the purpose of the bolActive field in tblCustomer and tblProduct?

**Status:** GROUNDED  
**GT Coverage:** 100% | **Top Score:** 0.9646 | **Gate:** `proceed`

**Expected answer:**
> The bolActive field (using Hungarian notation 'bol' for boolean/bit) is a flag indicating whether a record is active. In tblCustomer, it marks whether customers are included in marketing (1=active, 0=inactive). In tblProduct, it indicates product availability (1=available for sale, 0=discontinued).

**System answer:**
> For `tblCustomer`, the context explicitly states that customers “can be marked as inactive (`bolActive = 0`) but are never deleted.” So `tblCustomer.bolActive` is used to represent whether a customer is marked inactive versus retained in the system.

For `tblProduct`, the context confirms that the table includes a `bolActive` column, but it does not explicitly define that column’s purpose. What th…

### ✅ 12 — How are inventory transactions tracked in the system?

**Status:** GROUNDED  
**GT Coverage:** 100% | **Top Score:** 0.5403 | **Gate:** `proceed`

**Expected answer:**
> Inventory transactions are tracked in the inv_txn_log table, which records all stock movements. Each transaction has a type (txn_type): 'IN' for receipts, 'OUT' for shipments, and 'ADJ' for corrections. The table uses heavily abbreviated field names and references products via prod_id.

**System answer:**
> Inventory transactions are tracked through the business concept Inventory Transaction Log, which is implemented by the physical table `INV_TXN_LOG` (also referenced as `inv_txn_log`).

The retrieved context describes this table as an inventory transaction log, an inventory movement audit log tied to products, and an inventory audit trail. The documented columns are `txn_id`, `prod_id`, `txn_type`,…

### ✅ 13 — What is the self-referencing relationship in the Group table?

**Status:** GROUNDED  
**GT Coverage:** 100% | **Top Score:** 0.8858 | **Gate:** `proceed`

**Expected answer:**
> The Group table has a self-referencing foreign key where ParentGroupID references GroupID, creating a hierarchical structure for product categories. A NULL ParentGroupID indicates a top-level group, while non-NULL values create nested category levels.

**System answer:**
> The `GROUP` table is self-referencing through `ParentGroupID -> GROUP.GroupID`. In the business concept `Group Hierarchy`, this means each group can point to another row in the same `GROUP` table as its parent, forming a hierarchy using `GroupID` and `ParentGroupID`.

**System answer:**
> The retrieved context does not identify any `tblCustomer` columns as “migration compatibility columns.”

What the context explicitly shows is that `tblCustomer` has these columns: `strCustID`, `strFullName`, `strEmail`, `strRegion`, `strCountry`, `dtmCreated`, `dtmLastModified`, `bolActive`, `cust_id`, `customer_name`, and `txtNotes`.

### ✅ 16 — What is the inconsistent naming pattern between order tables?

**Status:** GROUNDED  
**GT Coverage:** 100% | **Top Score:** 0.2869 | **Gate:** `proceed`

**Expected answer:**
> The schema shows inconsistent naming: order headers use 'vw_SalesOrderHdr' with Hungarian notation, while line items use 'ord_line_item' with abbreviated underscore notation. Additionally, the line item table references lngOrderID but names its foreign key 'ord_id' instead of 'order_id' or 'lngOrder…

**System answer:**
> The order tables use different naming conventions. The order header is `vw_SalesOrderHdr`, which has a `vw_` prefix even though it is actually a table, while the order line table is `ord_line_item`, which uses the `ord_` prefix. The context also shows these two are related, since `ORD_LINE_ITEM.ORD_ID` references `VW_SALESORDERHDR.LNGORDERID`.

### ✅ 17 — What deprecated fields exist in tblProduct and why should they be avoided?

**Status:** GROUNDED  
**GT Coverage:** 100% | **Top Score:** 0.6637 | **Gate:** `proceed`

**Expected answer:**
> The tblProduct table contains three deprecated fields: prod_num (superseded by strSKU), item_desc (superseded by strDescription), and unit_cost (wrong data type with VARCHAR instead of DECIMAL). These fields should not be used in new code as they represent outdated design decisions.

**System answer:**
> In `tblProduct`, the deprecated legacy fields are `prod_num`, `item_desc`, and `unit_cost`.

`prod_num` (`VARCHAR 20`) is an old legacy product number that has been superseded by `strSKU` and is retained only for historical reporting, so it should not be used for new code.

`item_desc` (`VARCHAR 500`) is an old truncated description that has been superseded by `strDescription`, and the context exp…

### ✅ 19 — What is the relationship between User table passwords and security?

**Status:** GROUNDED  
**GT Coverage:** 100% | **Top Score:** 0.0401 | **Gate:** `proceed_with_warning`

**Expected answer:**
> The User table stores password hashes in the PasswordHash field, but uses SHA-256 without salt, making it vulnerable to rainbow table attacks. This is identified as a security issue in the data dictionary. Additionally, the table name 'User' is a SQL reserved word requiring square bracket quoting.

**System answer:**
> The business concept “System users” is implemented by the `User` table (`USER`), which includes the `PasswordHash` column. The security relationship called out in the context is critical: `User.PasswordHash` uses SHA-256 without salt, and this is explicitly identified as vulnerable to rainbow table attacks.

### ✅ 20 — What fields in vw_SalesOrderHdr use the 'flt' Hungarian notation prefix and what do they store?

**Status:** GROUNDED  
**GT Coverage:** 100% | **Top Score:** 0.9078 | **Gate:** `proceed`

**Expected answer:**
> The vw_SalesOrderHdr table uses the 'flt' (float) prefix for three monetary fields: fltSubTotal (line item subtotal before tax), fltTaxAmount (calculated tax), and fltTotalAmount (final total including tax and shipping). Despite the 'flt' prefix suggesting floating-point, these are defined as DECIMA…

**System answer:**
> In `vw_SalesOrderHdr`, the fields with the `flt` Hungarian notation prefix are `fltSubTotal`, `fltTaxAmount`, and `fltTotalAmount`.

From the glossary on Hungarian notation, `flt` denotes a float/money field (`DECIMAL`). Based on the column names in `vw_SalesOrderHdr`, these store the order subtotal, tax amount, and total amount, respectively.

### ✅ 21 — How does the schema handle the different date/time field naming conventions?

**Status:** GROUNDED

**System answer:**
> The schema does not use one consistent date/time naming convention.

In the legacy convention, Hungarian notation is used, where `dtm` means a `DATETIME` field. This pattern appears in tables such as `tblCustomer` and `tblProduct`, and in `vw_SalesOrderHdr`.

### ✅ 22 — What table prefix patterns exist in the schema and what do they indicate?

**Status:** GROUNDED  
**GT Coverage:** 100% | **Top Score:** 0.0907 | **Gate:** `proceed_with_warning`

**Expected answer:**

**System answer:**
> The schema uses several inconsistent table naming prefix patterns.

The `tbl` prefix is used for standard tables, for example `tblCustomer`, `tblProduct`, `tblPayment`, and `tblOrderStatusHistory`. The context describes this as part of the system’s table naming inconsistency rather than a strict semantic rule.

### ✅ 23 — What foreign key relationships exist for the vw_SalesOrderHdr table?

**Status:** GROUNDED  
**GT Coverage:** 100% | **Top Score:** 0.9902 | **Gate:** `proceed`

**System answer:**
> For `vw_SalesOrderHdr`, the retrieved context shows one outgoing foreign key and three incoming foreign keys.

`vw_SalesOrderHdr` references `tblCustomer` through `intCustID -> tblCustomer.strCustID`. The order header table’s key column is `lngOrderID`, and it is referenced by three other tables: `ord_line_item.ord_id -> vw_SalesOrderHdr.lngOrderID`, `tblPayment.OrderID -> vw_SalesOrderHdr.lngOrde…
