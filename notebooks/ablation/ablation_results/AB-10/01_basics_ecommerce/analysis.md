### ✅ Q001 — What information is stored for each customer?

**Status:** GROUNDED  
**GT Coverage:** 100% | **Top Score:** 0.2800 | **Gate:** `proceed`

**Expected answer:**
> Each customer has a unique ID, full name, email address, geographic region code, creation date, and active status. The email must be unique across all customers.

**System answer:**
> For each customer, the physical customer record is stored in CUSTOMER_MASTER, which is the master record for all registered platform customers. It stores:

CUST_ID, the unique customer identifier; FULL_NAME, the customer’s full name; EMAIL, the unique email address used for login; REGION_CODE, the geographic region used for tax; CREATED_AT, the account creation timestamp; and IS_ACTIVE, which indi…

### ✅ Q002 — How are products categorized on the platform?

**Status:** GROUNDED  
**GT Coverage:** 100% | **Top Score:** 0.1590 | **Gate:** `proceed_with_warning`

**Expected answer:**
> Products belong to categories which can have a parent category, forming a hierarchical tree structure. Each product references exactly one category through its CATEGORY_ID.

**System answer:**
> Products are categorized by linking each product record in TB_PRODUCT to a category in TB_CATEGORY through the CATEGORY_ID column. The relationship is explicitly defined as TB_PRODUCT.CATEGORY_ID → TB_CATEGORY.CATEGORY_ID.

The category structure is hierarchical: TB_CATEGORY has a self-referencing relationship through PARENT_CATEGORY_ID → TB_CATEGORY.CATEGORY_ID, which means categories can be arra…

**Status:** GROUNDED  
**GT Coverage:** 100% | **Top Score:** 0.9847 | **Gate:** `proceed`

**Expected answer:**
> Each sales order is placed by exactly one customer, referenced through the CUST_ID foreign key. A customer can place zero or more orders over time.

**System answer:**
> Customers and sales orders have a one-to-many relationship. The retrieved context states that a Sales Order is placed by exactly one Customer, and in the physical schema this is implemented by SALES_ORDER_HDR.CUST_ID as a foreign key to CUSTOMER_MASTER.CUST_ID.

So, schema-wise and business-wise, each row in SALES_ORDER_HDR belongs to one customer in CUSTOMER_MASTER. A customer is the party who pl…

### ✅ Q004 — What does an order line item contain?

**Status:** GROUNDED  
**GT Coverage:** 100% | **Top Score:** 0.8739 | **Gate:** `proceed`

**Expected answer:**
> An order line item specifies a product, the quantity ordered, the unit price at time of purchase, and the calculated extended amount. Each line item belongs to exactly one sales order.

**System answer:**
> An order line item, implemented by ORDER_LINE_ITEM, contains the details of an individual product purchase within a sales order. It includes a unique line identifier (LINE_ID), the parent order reference (ORDER_ID), the product reference (PRODUCT_ID), the quantity ordered (QUANTITY), the unit price at the time of order (UNIT_PRICE), and the extended line amount (LINE_AMT), which is quantity × unit…

### ✅ Q005 — How are payments linked to orders?

**Status:** GROUNDED  
**GT Coverage:** 100% | **Top Score:** 0.9232 | **Gate:** `proceed`

**Expected answer:**
> Each payment is associated with exactly one sales order through the ORDER_ID foreign key. Payments track the payment method, amount, status, and confirmation timestamp.

**System answer:**
> Payments are linked to orders by the foreign key PAYMENT.ORDER_ID → SALES_ORDER_HDR.ORDER_ID.

At the business level, the context states that a Payment is for exactly one Sales Order, and a Sales Order has one or more Payments. At the schema level, this means you relate payment records in PAYMENT to order header records in SALES_ORDER_HDR by joining PAYMENT.ORDER_ID = SALES_ORDER_HDR.ORDER_ID.

### ✅ Q006 — What statuses can an order have?

**Status:** GROUNDED  
**GT Coverage:** 100% | **Top Score:** 0.1803 | **Gate:** `proceed_with_warning`

**Expected answer:**
> Orders can have one of five statuses defined via CHECK constraint on SALES_ORDER_HDR.STATUS_CODE: PENDING (initial state when order is created), CONFIRMED (payment has been received), SHIPPED (dispatched to customer), DELIVERED (received by customer), or CANCELLED. The business glossary describes th…

**System answer:**
> The retrieved context shows that an order’s status is stored in SALES_ORDER_HDR.STATUS_CODE. It also shows related lifecycle fields on the order header: PAYMENT_CONFIRMED_AT and DELIVERED_AT.

However, the context does not provide the actual allowed order status values or code meanings. So from the available information, I can say only that orders have a status code in SALES_ORDER_HDR, but not wha…

### ✅ Q007 — Which table stores the product SKU information?

**Status:** GROUNDED  
**GT Coverage:** 100% | **Top Score:** 0.5995 | **Gate:** `proceed`

**Expected answer:**
> The TB_PRODUCT table stores the SKU (Stock Keeping Unit) code for each product, along with product name, category, price, and active status.

**System answer:**
> The product SKU information is stored in TB_PRODUCT, in the SKU column. The retrieved context maps the product-related concept to TB_PRODUCT and lists its columns as PRODUCT_ID, SKU, PRODUCT_NAME, CATEGORY_ID, UNIT_PRICE, and IS_ACTIVE.

**Sources retrieved (12):** `Hierarchical product category tree→TB_PRODUCT`, `item→ORDER_LINE_ITEM`, `parent_chunk_data_dictionary.txt_3`, `ORDER_LINE_ITEM→TB_PRODUCT`, `Hierarchical product category tree→TB_CATEGORY`, `parent_chunk_business_glossary.txt_0`, `TB_PRODUCT→TB_CATEGORY`, `Customer Master→CUSTOMER_MASTER`

### ✅ Q008 — How can I find all orders placed by a specific customer?

**Status:** GROUNDED  
**GT Coverage:** 100% | **Top Score:** 0.1428 | **Gate:** `proceed_with_warning`

**Expected answer:**
> Query the SALES_ORDER_HDR table filtering by CUST_ID. Each order has a foreign key reference to CUSTOMER_MASTER.CUST_ID, so joining these tables on CUST_ID will show all orders for a customer along with their details.

**System answer:**
> Use SALES_ORDER_HDR and CUSTOMER_MASTER.

The direct relationship is SALES_ORDER_HDR.CUST_ID → CUSTOMER_MASTER.CUST_ID, and the context also states that a Sales Order is placed by exactly one Customer.

So, to find all orders placed by a specific customer, use this path:

CUSTOMER_MASTER.CUST_ID = SALES_ORDER_HDR.CUST_ID

If you already know the customer’s ID, filter SALES_ORDER_HDR by CUST_ID.

### ✅ Q009 — What products were included in a specific order?

**Status:** GROUNDED  
**GT Coverage:** 83% | **Top Score:** 0.0782 | **Gate:** `proceed_with_warning`

**Expected answer:**
> Join ORDER_LINE_ITEM with TB_PRODUCT on PRODUCT_ID. For order ORDER_ID, the line items show which products were ordered, in what quantity, and at what price.

**System answer:**
> The knowledge graph does not contain actual order records, so it cannot tell which products were included in a specific order instance. It contains schema metadata only.

From the schema, products included in an order are stored in ORDER_LINE_ITEM, which represents the individual product lines within a sales order. To determine the products for a given order, use the order’s ORDER_ID and trace:

### ✅ Q010 — Show me the order hierarchy from customer to line items.

**Status:** GROUNDED  
**GT Coverage:** 100% | **Top Score:** 0.3719 | **Gate:** `proceed`

**Expected answer:**
> The hierarchy is: Customer (CUSTOMER_MASTER) → SalesOrder (SALES_ORDER_HDR) → OrderLineItem (ORDER_LINE_ITEM) → Product (TB_PRODUCT). Each customer has orders, each order has line items, and each line item references a product.

**System answer:**
> The order hierarchy from customer to line items is:

Customer is implemented by CUSTOMER_MASTER, with primary key CUST_ID. Sales orders are implemented by SALES_ORDER_HDR, and SALES_ORDER_HDR.CUST_ID is a foreign key to CUSTOMER_MASTER.CUST_ID. This means a sales order is placed by exactly one customer.

From the order header, line items are implemented by ORDER_LINE_ITEM. ORDER_LINE_ITEM.ORDER_ID…

### ✅ Q011 — What happens when a payment is confirmed for an order?

**Status:** GROUNDED  
**GT Coverage:** 100% | **Top Score:** 0.3521 | **Gate:** `proceed`

**Expected answer:**
> When payment is confirmed, the PAYMENT record's STATUS_CODE becomes 'CONFIRMED', the CONFIRMED_AT timestamp is set, and the associated SALES_ORDER_HDR can progress from PENDING to CONFIRMED status.

**System answer:**
> The retrieved context does not state a business process outcome such as shipment release or status transition when a payment is confirmed.

What it does show is that payment confirmation is tracked in the schema for the order:

The PAYMENT table stores one payment for exactly one sales order via PAYMENT.ORDER_ID → SALES_ORDER_HDR.ORDER_ID, and it includes STATUS_CODE and CONFIRMED_AT. The SALES_OR…

### ✅ Q012 — How are shipments related to orders and warehouses?

**Status:** GROUNDED  
**GT Coverage:** 100% | **Top Score:** 0.3848 | **Gate:** `proceed`

**Expected answer:**
> Each shipment is for exactly one sales order (ORDER_ID in SHIPMENT references SALES_ORDER_HDR). The shipment also specifies the source warehouse code and includes tracking information and delivery status.

**System answer:**
> Shipments are related to orders and warehouses as follows: a Sales Order has one or more Shipments, and each Shipment is for exactly one Sales Order and comes from exactly one Warehouse.

In the physical schema, the Shipment concept is implemented by the SHIPMENT table, which includes SHIPMENT_ID, ORDER_ID, WAREHOUSE_CODE, SHIPPED_AT, TRACKING_NUMBER, and STATUS_CODE. The order relationship is exp…

### ✅ Q013 — Can a product belong to multiple categories?

**Status:** GROUNDED  
**GT Coverage:** 100% | **Top Score:** 0.3613 | **Gate:** `proceed`

**Expected answer:**
> No, each product belongs to exactly one category. The TB_PRODUCT table has a CATEGORY_ID foreign key referencing TB_CATEGORY, which stores a single category value per product.

**System answer:**
> Based on the retrieved context, a product appears to belong to only one category directly.

The schema shows `TB_PRODUCT` has a single `CATEGORY_ID` column, and `TB_PRODUCT` references `TB_CATEGORY` via the foreign key `CATEGORY_ID -> TB_CATEGORY.CATEGORY_ID`. There is no junction table or multiple category reference shown for products. The category hierarchy is modeled in `TB_CATEGORY` itself thr…

### ✅ Q014 — Is it possible for a customer to place an order without payment?

**Status:** GROUNDED  
**GT Coverage:** 100% | **Top Score:** 0.0719 | **Gate:** `proceed_with_warning`

**Expected answer:**
> Yes, an order can exist without payment. SALES_ORDER_HDR has STATUS_CODE defaulting to PENDING and PAYMENT_CONFIRMED_AT is nullable (NULL when no payment yet). The PAYMENT table links via ORDER_ID foreign key but nothing prevents an order from existing without a payment row. However, the business gl…

**System answer:**
> Based on the retrieved context, a customer cannot have a Sales Order with no payment record. The business relationships state that a Sales Order is placed by exactly one Customer and has one or more Payments, and the PAYMENT table is linked to SALES_ORDER_HDR through ORDER_ID.

So at the schema/business-rule level, an order without any payment is not allowed.

### ✅ Q015 — What is the total value of all orders placed by a customer?

**Status:** GROUNDED  
**GT Coverage:** 100% | **Top Score:** 0.0325 | **Gate:** `proceed_with_warning`

**Expected answer:**
> Sum the TOTAL_AMT column from SALES_ORDER_HDR for all records where CUST_ID matches the customer's ID. This aggregates the monetary value of all orders placed by that customer.

**System answer:**
> The knowledge graph contains schema-level metadata only, not actual customer order records, so it cannot tell you the numeric total for a specific customer.

From the schema, the total value of all orders placed by a customer would be calculated from SALES_ORDER_HDR, which is the header-level sales order table and contains CUST_ID and TOTAL_AMT. At the schema level, this means: sum SALES_ORDER_HDR…
