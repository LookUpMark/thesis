**Status:** GROUNDED  
**GT Coverage:** 83% | **Top Score:** 0.0000 | **Gate:** `proceed`

**Expected answer:**
> For the work_order's product_id, perform recursive BOM explosion to get all required components with quantities. For each component, sum the available quantity (quantity_on_hand - quantity_reserved) across all warehouses from the inventory table. Compare aggregated available inventory against requir…

**Expected answer:**
> Query the batch table filtering for expiry_date within a warning window (e.g., next 30 days) or past expiry. Join with the bom table recursively on product_id to trace all components used in those batches. Join with component_supplier and supplier tables to filter by specific suppliers. Results iden…

**Status:** GROUNDED  
**GT Coverage:** 100% | **Top Score:** 0.0000 | **Gate:** `proceed`

**Expected answer:**
> Start with a shipment from the supplier (shipment table with supplier_id and shipment_type = 'INBOUND'). Track to inventory updates via component_id and warehouse_id. Identify batches that consumed the component via reverse BOM lookup (batch.product_id → bom hierarchy → component_id). Query quality_…

**Status:** GROUNDED  
**GT Coverage:** 100% | **Top Score:** 0.0000 | **Gate:** `proceed`

**Expected answer:**
> Perform recursive BOM explosion to get all leaf products/components. For material cost: join component_supplier (using component_id from components matching BOM leaf products) to get unit_price from preferred supplier (is_preferred='Y'), then multiply by accumulated BOM quantity.
